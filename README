rtl-sdr
turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
======================================================================

For more information see:

my project is to add a gui (written in python) that communicates with
librtlsdr in any app to control R820t gains separately.

CURRENT STATE:
the gui app is in rtlsdr-control
monitors current gain settings of first rtlsdr device. Reported values are
only valid if a librtlsdr app is running at the same time, uses first rtlsdr
device and it is a device with R82xx tuner.

Setting gains work now. If the set button does not become active again it
means the command sent to the librtlsdr app is not finished. Or it is not
even running.
Setting the gains only works when the librtlsdr app is actively transferring
data from the device.
