rtl-sdr
turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
======================================================================

For more information see:
http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

my project is to add a gui (written in python) that communicates with
librtlsdr in any app to control R820t gains separately.

CURRENT STATE:
the gui app is in rtlsdr-control
monitors current gain settings of first rtlsdr device. Reported values are
only valid if a librtlsdr app is running at the same time, uses first rtlsdr
device and it is an R820t.
